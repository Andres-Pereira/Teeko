# Teeko
 
We created our own teeko version that can be played with 2 real players or the computer as an opponent.
The game will show a 5x5 matrix that will be representing our board, each space will be called a cell.
The number 1 will be representing the black markers, the number 2 the red ones.
The number 0 is defined as a blank space, that means that either 1 or 2 can mark.
A match will have his own board and functions to make sure that the game follows the rules.

The rules of the game are in the link below:
